## üí° How It Works

### Energy Flow Process

**1. Solar Generation**
Your 30 solar panels convert sunlight into DC electricity throughout the day. The panels use advanced N-type TOPCon technology for maximum efficiency and are mounted on a water ballast system requiring no roof penetration.

**2. Power Optimization**
Three MPPT (Maximum Power Point Tracking) charge controllers continuously optimize power extraction from the solar array, converting variable DC voltage to the optimal 48V for battery charging.

**3. Energy Storage**
Excess solar energy is stored in four LiFePO4 batteries (the safest lithium chemistry) providing 19.2kWh total capacity. These batteries can power your home for days or weeks depending on usage.

**4. AC Conversion**
The hybrid inverter converts 48V DC from batteries to 230V AC for your home appliances. It also manages grid connection for importing/exporting power as needed.

**5. Smart Control**
The Cerbo GX system monitors and controls the entire setup, optimizing energy usage, providing remote monitoring, and ensuring safe operation.

### Operating Modes

**Sunny Day Mode**
- Solar powers house directly
- Excess charges batteries to 100%
- Surplus exported to grid for income
- Minimal grid import required

**Cloudy Day Mode**
- Reduced solar + battery power
- Grid supplements when needed
- Smart switching maintains comfort

**Night Mode**
- Battery powers entire house
- Grid backup when batteries reach minimum level
- Automatic switching ensures no interruption

**Power Cut Mode**
- System operates in "island mode"
- Solar + battery only (off-grid)
- Critical loads maintained automatically

- **Backup communication:** Consider cellular backup for monitoring

### üîß **Key Questions for Your Installer:**

1. **"What's the islanding time during power cuts?"** (Should be <20ms)
2. **"How do we manually bypass the system if needed?"**
3. **"What monitoring/alerting options are included?"**
4. **"Is the battery cabinet location optimal for temperature?"**
5. **"What surge protection is included?"**
6. **"Can we add a generator inlet for extreme emergencies?"**
7. **"How do we expand batteries/solar later?"**

### üìä **My Assessment: You're in Excellent Shape!**

**System Strengths:**
- **Massive overcapacity** for your usage = exceptional resilience
- **Professional components** with excellent track records
- **Modular design** allows easy expansion/repair
- **Hybrid capability** provides grid backup when needed

**Confidence Level:** 9/10 - This is a very robust, well-designed system

The only real vulnerability is relying on a single inverter, but Victron reliability is excellent, and you have grid backup. Your usage pattern vs. system capacity provides enormous resilience.

**Bottom Line:** You've designed an exceptionally robust system. Focus on ensuring proper installation quality and you'll have decades of reliable operation!
